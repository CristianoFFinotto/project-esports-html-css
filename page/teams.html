                        up to the LEC roster in the upcoming 2019 Summer Split. While playing for REC, he won Ultraliga

                Paris Saint-Germain have been pioneers in the world of eSports by becoming the first big European
                professional to launch their professional eSports section back in 2016, and did so with big ambitions.
                First of all on FIFA and then on other major titles in the market, the club made their way into one of
                the biggest in the eSports world scene.
                Through multiple strategic partnerships with major teams, notably in Asia, the Club was able to gain
                notoriety and assert their position as a major part of the biggest licenses in the world such as FIFA,
                Dota 2, League of Legends, Brawl Stars or Rocket League.

                    <p> After Mata and Looper's departures, Royal Never Give Up picked up LetMe for the top lane and
                        Ming as their new support. They would finish 1st place in Group A of the 2017 LPL Spring Season
                        with a 12-4 regular season record. In the playoffs although they made it to the finals, they
                        lost 0-3 in dominating fashion to Team WE. The 2017 LPL Summer Season was very similar as RNG
                        finished again in 1st place with the same 12-4 regular season record, only this time in Group B.
                        The playoffs went similarly to the spring playoffs for the team. They made it all the way to the
                        finals again but lost 2-3 to EDward Gaming in a reverse sweep this time. Although RNG failed to
                        win a domestic title in 2017, Xiaohu was very impressive individually and earned an MVP of the
                        split award for himself.

                        At the 2017 Season World Championship RNG was placed into Group C along with eventual tournament
                        winners Samsung Galaxy, as well as G2 Esports and 1907 Fenerbahçe Esports. The team performed
                        incredibly well in their group and went 5-1. They only dropped one game to G2 Esports. In the
                        Quarterfinals their opponent was Fnatic and they defeated them 3-1 in convincing fashion. RNG's
                        Worlds run ended in the Semifinals after a 2-3 loss to SK Telecom T1 in a very close series.

                        In the remake of the game one day later he scored another pentakill.

                        biggest rival, Fnatic. With Perkz moving to the bot lane to make room for the best player in the
                        West, Caps was quick to show the title was well deserved with a dominating year long performance
                        and winning MVP for the LEC Spring Split and MSI 2019. Moreover, he went on to make history as
                        the first Western back-to-back Worlds finalist. But being the king of the mid lane just wasn’t
                        enough – and so Caps swapped with Perkz, debuting as a bot laner for 2020. For Summer Split,
                        having proven his dominance in bot lane, he swapped back with Perkz and returned to the mid
                        lane.
                        Popping opponents on assassins, mages, and marksmen, Caps is sure to dazzle with his mechanical
                        talents and lovable personality. Furthermore, no matter if it’s Claps or Craps on the Rift, the
                        fan favourite from Denmark can count on the support of his entire family, especially his father,
                        who travels the world to see his son win title after title.
